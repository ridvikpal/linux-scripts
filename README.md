# ridvikpal/linux-scripts

These are a collection of bash scripts I created to automate things such as backing up my files, installing programs and keeping my laptop awake when needed. For some of these scripts I created .desktop files so I can quickly run them as desktop apps.

Please note that I use Debian 13, so some commands may not be consistent across other *nix flavours and distributions. For example, the hardcoded paths like `/home/ridvikpal` will obviously need to be changed for your username. Feel free to copy these and modify them to your needs!
